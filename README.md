# FortiFile v0.1


FortiFile is a modular and extensible command-line tool for file sanitization and analysis operations, with a text-based terminal interface. The initial goal is to sanitize files, but the project will be scalable to include additional functionality such as metadata removal, entropy analysis, file vulnerability assessment, malware scanning and removal, proactive data loss prevention (DLP), and other security operations.
